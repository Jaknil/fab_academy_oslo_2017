Applications for Fab Academy 2018 in Oslo will open 1 september 2017.  

Starting in February 2018 6-8 admitted Oslo students will be able to participate in an international course in how to make almost anything using digital fabrication techniques such as 3D printing, microelectronics design, production and programming, large scale CNC-milling, laser cutting, moulding and casting, composites and more. 

Weekly lectures will be held by video conference by Boston MIT professor [Niel Gershenfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Gershenfeld) and the Oslo students will have access to and use the brand new [Fellesvekstedet Fab Lab at Seilduksgata.](https://www.facebook.com/fellesverkstedet/) The local hands on instructor and coordinator for the Oslo group will be [Jakob Nilsson, who took Fab Academy 2017](http://archive.fabacademy.org/archives/2017/fablabverket/students/100/) the Remote Guru will be Ohadino Haad who is Director of Academic Research & Development at [Stratasys](http://www.stratasys.com/)

The course is fast paced with a new concept introduced each week, finishing of with a final project there the students demonstrate integration of the skills they have learned on the way. The course is highly adaptable to the students existing skill level and the their own ideas. Already skilled makers are able to challange themselves to grow and beginners will have great help from studying the examples provided by their previous and current class mates which number in the hundreds each year.
